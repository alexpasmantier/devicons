## Features

- ðŸ¦ž **Icon Retrieval**: Get file or directory icons based on file name/extension.
- ðŸ¦ž **Icon Color**: Retrieve the color associated with the icon depending on the specified theme.
- ðŸ¦ž **Filetype Support**: Supports a wide range of filetypes and filename conventions (dockerfile, makefile, etc.).
- ðŸ¦ž **Customizable Themes**: Supports both light and dark themes.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
devicons = "0.1.0"
```

_**NOTE**: you'll need to use a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to properly display the icons._

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `devicons` to retrieve a file icon with the dark theme:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use your_library::{File, Theme, icon_for_file};

fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("example.txt");
    let file = File::new(path);

    let icon = icon_for_file(&file, Some(Theme::Dark));

    println!("File: {}", file.name);
    println!("Icon: {}", icon.icon);
    println!("Color: {}", icon.color);
}
```
